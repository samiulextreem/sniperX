## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Twitter/X API Developer Account ([Get one here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard))

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samiulextreem/sniperX.git
cd sniperX
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure API credentials:
```bash
cp config.example.ini config.ini
```

4. Edit `config.ini` and add your Twitter API credentials:
```ini
[twitter]
bearer_token = your_bearer_token_here
```

## Usage

### Basic Analysis

Run a complete analysis of Elon's recent tweets:

```bash
python sniperx.py --analyze
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Analyze specific number of tweets
python sniperx.py --analyze --limit 100

# Set custom confidence threshold
python sniperx.py --analyze --min-confidence 0.8

# Save results to JSON file
python sniperx.py --analyze --output report.json

# Analyze a different account
python sniperx.py --analyze --target elonmusk

# Use custom config file
python sniperx.py --analyze --config my_config.ini
```

### Demo Mode

If you don't have API credentials yet, you can run in demo mode to see sample output:

```bash
python sniperx.py --analyze
```

The tool will detect missing credentials and generate a simulated report.

## Configuration

The `config.ini` file allows you to customize analysis parameters:

### Twitter API Settings
```ini
[twitter]
bearer_token = your_bearer_token_here
```

### Analysis Settings
```ini
[analysis]
target_handle = elonmusk      # Twitter handle to analyze
tweet_limit = 200              # Number of tweets to fetch
min_confidence = 0.7           # Minimum signal confidence (0-1)
```

### Trading Keywords
```ini
[trading]
crypto_keywords = bitcoin,btc,ethereum,eth,dogecoin,doge,crypto
stock_keywords = tesla,tsla,stock,shares
positive_threshold = 0.3       # Sentiment threshold for bullish signals
negative_threshold = -0.3      # Sentiment threshold for bearish signals
```

## How It Works

### 1. Tweet Collection
- Fetches recent tweets from the target account using Twitter API v2
- Filters out retweets and replies to focus on original content

### 2. Pattern Analysis
- **Frequency Analysis**: Calculates tweet posting patterns over time
- **Burst Detection**: Identifies periods of unusually high activity
- **Content Analysis**: Extracts common themes and keywords
- **Sentiment Tracking**: Monitors sentiment changes and shifts
- **Timing Correlation**: Analyzes relationship between posting time and engagement

### 3. Signal Generation
- Detects mentions of crypto or stock keywords
- Analyzes sentiment polarity (positive/negative)
- Calculates confidence based on:
  - Sentiment strength and subjectivity
  - Engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies)
  - Timing patterns (high-engagement hours)
  - Burst activity correlation
- Ranks signals by urgency and confidence

### 4. Report Generation
- Produces actionable signals with clear recommendations
- Provides context including tweet content and timing
- Highlights high-priority signals

## API Rate Limits

Twitter API has rate limits:
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: 450 requests per 15-minute window
- **Tweet Lookup**: 300 requests per 15-minute window

The tool is designed to work within these limits for typical usage.

## Troubleshooting

### "No tweets fetched"
- Check your bearer token is correct
- Verify the target handle exists and is public
- Check your API access level (need v2 access)

### "Configuration file not found"
- Make sure you copied `config.example.ini` to `config.ini`
- Check the file is in the same directory as `sniperx.py`

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Wait 15 minutes before retrying
- Reduce the `tweet_limit` in config
